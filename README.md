# Simple Chat

## Description
This Simple Chat is designed as a straightforward, real-time chat interface using Flask for the backend and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. It's created as a response to more complex solutions, offering a simple, effective baseline for building chat bots and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Its simplicity makes it an ideal starting point for customizations and further developments in chatbot technology.
